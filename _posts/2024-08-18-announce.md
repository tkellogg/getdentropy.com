We're pleased to announce the new dentropy website, I hope you appreciate it. After talking to many of you,
we discovered that we badly needed a communication tool to address some common questions.

First, dentropy is about using knowledge graphs to power AI. 

I can talk at length about why the current generation of AI is flawed
and knowledge graphs are the answer. Unfortunately these knowledge graphs are _**hard to create**_. 

Dentropy makes it as easy
as taking notes, or reading blogs, social media, etc.

Another way to see it, dentropy is "de-entropy". Where entropy is disorder, dentropy removes that disorder and provides
organization. But more importantly, it's intuitive to use.

Second, it's a sort of personal assistant. So useful that everyone should have one. We think it would be tremendously beneficial
to companies as well, as a form of knowledge sharing.

Give it a spin. Right now we don't have a beta out yet. Feel free to fill out the [signup form](/signup/), and we'll get
back to you when we're ready to ship a beta. At this point, our minds are churning with ideas, and we could really use your
input about how you think it would be most useful.
